<h1>Top 3 best Russian movies that I have seen</h1>
<h2></h2>
<hr>
<h3>Brother 2</h3>
<p>The GOAT. Serious movie about a Russian hitman travelling to the USA to take revenge for his friend's brother.</p>
<h3>Dead man's bluff</h3>
<p>Some places dark, but overall a great comedy filmed in my city.</p>
<h3>Kalashnikov</h3>
<p>A great documentary, telling the biography of Mikhail Kalashnikov and his development of an AK rifle.</p>
